# ZaoFu Issue Plan Synthesis

## Goal

Turn a bug/issue request plus triage evidence into a small repair plan and a
dispatchable `task_map.json`. The plan must let implementation workers start
without rereading the entire conversation.

## Inputs To Preserve

- User issue statement and reproduction facts.
- Triage findings, suspected root cause, and unknowns.
- Files, commands, logs, or UI states used as evidence.
- Any scope boundaries or blocked paths from `zf.yaml`.

## Required Outputs

Write:

- `issue-plan.md`: concise human plan with root-cause hypothesis, slices,
  verification, and risks.
- `task_map.json`: writer-fanout task map.
- `source_index.json`: evidence/source list.

Emit top-level `plan_artifact_ref`, `task_map_ref`, `source_index_ref`,
`artifact_refs`, and `evidence_refs`. Do not put these only inside `report`.
Also declare the logical inputs consumed by the task map through
`required_plan_ports`; use `issue_spec`, `goal_claim_set`, `task_map`, and
`planning_result` unless the issue profile narrows them. Runtime owns Package
construction/current selection, so do not emit Package lifecycle events.

## Source Provenance

Every issue task must preserve the issue evidence that justifies it. Add one
of these to each task:

- `source_key` / `source_keys` for issue, triage, log, or reproduction anchors.
- `source_ref` / `source_refs` for files, UI states, logs, or report sections.
- `source_excerpt` for the exact observed symptom or root-cause fact.

If the task body is compact, write `source_index.json` with `tasks[]` or
`task_sources[]` entries keyed by `task_id`. A global `sources[]` list is only
acceptable for a legacy one-task issue plan; use per-task anchors for all new
outputs.

## Task Design

Prefer one or two vertical fixes:

- `dev-core` for backend/runtime/kernel/CLI changes.
- `dev-web` for dashboard/browser-visible changes.

Each task needs `allowed_paths`, expected behavior, verification command, and
handoff evidence for verify agents. One exclusive file must have exactly one
task owner across the map. Dependency serialization does not permit duplicate
`exclusive_files`; merge those changes into one owner task or mark a truly
shared/read-only path as non-exclusive.

Treat every capability promised by the issue, root Task contract, or task
description as an observable contract, not prose. Each such capability must
have all of the following in the same behavior-owning task:

- a mandatory acceptance criterion;
- the production path that implements it;
- a focused test or real-environment evidence producer;
- a canonical validation command bound to that acceptance id.

This applies independently to every user-facing surface. For example, a task
that promises a CLI cannot use API tests as a substitute: it must own the CLI
entrypoint and CLI tests, and its command must exercise the promised
subcommands, scriptable failures, and exit codes. The same rule applies to API,
Web, runtime, replay, security, and packaging behavior. Assembly or release
tasks may aggregate receipts but cannot substitute for a behavior producer.

## Cumulative Replan Discipline

A stage replan is an amendment to the latest admitted plan, not a fresh plan.
Read the previous task map and the complete rework context before editing.

Start from an exact copy of the latest serialized `task_map.json` and apply a
field-level patch. Do not regenerate, summarize, or rename the plan while
repairing a critic finding. In particular, preserve these fields byte-for-byte
unless the finding explicitly requires changing that exact field:

- task ids, titles, descriptions, dependencies, affinity, and source anchors;
- acceptance ids and full acceptance statements;
- goal-claim ids and their task ownership;
- verification owners, tiers, commands, and matrix bindings;
- allowed/exclusive paths outside the ownership conflict being repaired.

If the finding concerns command binding or file ownership, change only the
command/matrix binding and the minimum related ownership paths. Semantic
compression such as replacing an observable acceptance statement with a short
label is plan regression, even when the goal-claim id remains present.

- Preserve every fix that a later critic explicitly accepted.
- Change only the tasks, claims, paths, acceptance criteria, commands, and
  matrices implicated by unresolved findings.
- Re-run exact goal-claim coverage after every amendment; no claim may disappear
  or be silently reassigned to an evidence-only task.
- Re-run the observable-contract check above for the entire resulting task map,
  including capabilities that were not named by the latest finding.
- If a prior fix must move owners, move its production path, focused test,
  acceptance criterion, and command together.
- Compare the previous and proposed serialized plans before submission. Every
  changed field must be traceable to one unresolved finding; otherwise restore
  the previous value. If a safe minimal patch cannot be made, report blocked
  instead of submitting a semantically weaker plan.

## Completion Check

Before emitting success:

1. `task_map.json` is valid JSON and contains non-empty `tasks`.
2. Every task has `task_id`, owner/affinity, `allowed_paths`, acceptance, and
   verification.
3. Every task has direct source anchors or is mapped by `source_index_ref`.
4. The success payload has top-level `task_map_ref`.
5. When matrix plan ports are required, apply the full id-set closure check in
   `zf-project-adapter-matrix-enrichment` to the final serialized payload.
6. Every root goal claim is owned exactly once and has an observable acceptance
   plus producer/test/command evidence; task-description-only capabilities are
   a failed completion check.
7. On replan, all critic-accepted fixes from earlier attempts remain present in
   the final serialized task map and matrices.
8. On replan, task ids, acceptance ids, full acceptance statements, goal-claim
   ownership, and unaffected source/validation bindings match the previous
   serialized plan exactly.

## Goal Closure Loop

Issue plans are allowed to evolve after verify. If later evidence shows the
issue is still not fixed, use:

- `zf-verify-rescan-replan` to compare the implemented behavior with the
  original issue and reproduction evidence.
- `zf-goal-closure-replan-contract` with `goal_kind: "issue"` and
  `gap_category: "issue_gap"` to produce `goal-gap-plan.v1`.
- `zf-gap-task-synth` to append only the missing repair work through
  `task_map.amended` / `task_map.ready` with `resume_scope:
  "gap_tasks_only"`.

Do not ask workers to restart the full issue plan when a bounded gap task can
close the remaining behavior.
